</p>

 * **Robust Customization**
 
   Customers and users may focus on their own concerns while filing tickets using osTicket's customizable forms, data lists, and fields. The solution also gives you control over the information it displays by allowing you to select the criteria for the ticket queue's ranking. 

 * **Ticket Filters**
    
    The software streamlines the routing of tickets to the correct department. It also allows you to set actions to send canned responses and to reject tickets. Moreover, the response time can be accelerated by configuring help topics.

  * **Automated Help Desk**

    Client involvement is ensured by delivering automatic answers to messages as soon as they arrive. Depending on the nature of the department, these individual messages can be updated or altered. This function allows agents to focus on more essential messages since it saves time.

  * **Reliable Customer Portal**
   
    The help desk allows registered users to look for answers. It also makes the knowledgebase more efficient. Customers will be able to get answers without having to wait for a response from your support team. It also reduces the amount of work your support agents have to do.
