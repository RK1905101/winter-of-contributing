## Introduction
XMind is one of the famous open source mind mapping software. We can easily demonstrate our thoughts and ideas into self-organised charts and share them through this app.

So why we use Mind maps? Visuals speak more than anything. We can record every idea which emerges out from our creativity. Not only we can capture every inspiration at a snap anywhere, anytime
also, it is easy to structure and organize them easily.  

Opportunities comes, but they never stay longer. So prepare yourself with a Jot down ideas, passion, and strengths to stand out using these mindmaps.

XMind is focused on both usability and extendability. Currently available tools in XMind are, mind maps, fishbone diagrams, tree diagrams, org-charts, and spreadsheets.

It was initially founded in 2006 by Brian Sun who is founder and CEO of XMind Ltd. It is Cross-platform and a Library with rich features. They provide workshops around the world. 

For XMind Pro/Zen, it can export the mind maps into Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, PDF documents. 

* File format: Contents of XMind are saved in XMind workbook file format, with .xmind or .xmap format suffix is used. 

 The implementation consist of a ZIP compressed archive containing an XML document for contents, for styles, .png image file for thumbnails, and some directories for attachments.

## Benifits of using XMind
* We can include XMind in our study routine.  You can easily connect two different topics by using boundary feature.

 Mind maps helps to get general view of topic and able to revise topics easily and in quick manner.
* It become very difficult to take decisions sometime. There is clear explanation on how we do it. Expand all the factors on which you want to explore. 

Evaluate each factor. Connect the dots. Weigh and decide if you need resource, time etc. 

* Prepare for the future of hybrid events with mindmap. Gaining the tools and knowledge needed to run a successful hybrid event is very necessary. 
XMind is right choice if you want to explore a new set of features.

There are many such benifits, if you want to find some more,  visit reference section.
