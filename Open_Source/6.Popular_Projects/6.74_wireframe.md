Many web wireframing tools will let you drag and drop placeholder elements for images, text, banners, and logos to help you get a feel for your first draft design. wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics.

##  Why Create a Wireframe?
A design prototype will go through many different versions. It’s easier, and often cheaper, to start with a wireframe. This is a sketch of what the site will look like, without color, fonts, graphics, or text. This stripped-down version lets you focus on the user experience of the website. It’s easier to fix a UX element at the wireframe stage, compared with later on down in the design process. It may also be easier to spot a problematic UX feature before it’s obscured by appealing graphics later on.

For those schooled in coding or early website development, it’s helpful to think of the wireframe as a visual sitemap. The sitemap is a simple list that represents the hierarchy of pages on the website. Instead of a linear representation of how elements link together, a wireframe is a visual map, much like a blueprint.

That said, a wireframe does not have to be a simple sketch. A low-fidelity wireframe has only the basic layout, but a high-fidelity wireframe may introduce more precise design elements. That gives you and your team the flexibility to ease into the perspective of the end users, with increasingly complex details.

At all stages it’s key to envision the movement of the user through the website. UX is how a client knows the website is performing its job — attracting and engaging users to ultimately perform a task. You and the team should make it as easy as possible for them to convert, however conversion is defined by the client.
