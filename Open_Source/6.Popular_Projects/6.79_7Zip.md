## What is 7-Zip

7-Zip is an **archiver** it is used to arrange your files by creating a cabinet of comparable files. The nicest part of file compression is that it reduces the size of the archived file or files. As a result, you'll have even more room to store new and larger files. The 7zip archiving programme may also be configured to consolidate items into a single archive and encrypt or password-protect them. This is quite handy and beneficial, especially when delivering sensitive data over the internet.
